## Report

### Introduction

"sustainable fashion detector."  

This is a fascinating concept that blends technology with the growing need for more ethical and environmentally conscious clothing choices.  Essentially, a sustainable fashion detector aims to help consumers make informed decisions about their clothing purchases by providing information about the sustainability credentials of a garment or brand.



### Challenges Faced

- Encountering Noisy Data: At the project's inception, we encountered a dataset riddled with noise comprising inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information. This compromised the integrity of our data, leading to diminished model efficiency and, in some instances, negative performance metrics.

- Ineffective Model Adjustments: Despite implementing various models and fine-tuning multiple parameters, the pervasive noise within the dataset hindered any significant improvement in performance.

- Strategic Dataset Replacement: Recognizing the detrimental impact of the noisy data, we made the critical decision to replace the initial dataset. This entailed restarting the entire modeling process with a new, cleaner dataset, which subsequently resulted in enhanced efficiency across the models previously tested.

This experience underscores the profound impact that data quality has on machine learning outcomes. Noisy data can lead to decreased accuracy, overfitting, and misleading insights, as models may struggle to discern true patterns from erroneous information. Addressing such challenges often necessitates comprehensive data cleaning or, as in our case, the adoption of an alternative dataset to ensure reliable and valid results.
