## Report

### Introduction

"sustainable fashion detector."  

This is a fascinating concept that blends technology with the growing need for more ethical and environmentally conscious clothing choices.  Essentially, a sustainable fashion detector aims to help consumers make informed decisions about their clothing purchases by providing information about the sustainability credentials of a garment or brand.

#### 1. Ideation Process

The idea for Puck Power Clash emerged from brainstorming sessions where we explored different concepts for a 2D game. 
Our primary goal was to create a game that is simple to learn but has engaging mechanics to keep players interested. 
We considered various arcade-style games and ultimately chose an air hockey-inspired game because it offers:
- Fast-paced gameplay that keeps players engaged. 
- A well-known concept that can be easily adapted.

Opportunities to introduce novel elements like power-ups and dynamic obstacles and goal posts.

As a team, we debated different features and gameplay mechanics. We used collaborative tools like Miro and Google Docs 
to map out ideas and discuss feasibility. Each team member contributed ideas, and we voted on which mechanics to 
implement in our first version.

#### 2. Early Stages of Design

In the early design phase, we focused on:

- Defining core mechanics: paddle movement, puck physics, and scoring system. 
- Introducing power-ups: speed boost, reverse puck direction, and freeze opponentâ€™s paddle. 
- Adding dynamic obstacles like rotating barriers to increase challenge. 
- Establishing a simple, visually appealing UI using p5.js.

To visualize these concepts, we created rough sketches and flowcharts to represent the game logic. 
We also developed wireframes to define the layout of the game elements on the screen.

### Challenges Faced

- Encountering Noisy Data: At the project's inception, we encountered a dataset riddled with noise comprising inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information. This compromised the integrity of our data, leading to diminished model efficiency and, in some instances, negative performance metrics.

- Ineffective Model Adjustments: Despite implementing various models and fine-tuning multiple parameters, the pervasive noise within the dataset hindered any significant improvement in performance.

- Strategic Dataset Replacement: Recognizing the detrimental impact of the noisy data, we made the critical decision to replace the initial dataset. This entailed restarting the entire modeling process with a new, cleaner dataset, which subsequently resulted in enhanced efficiency across the models previously tested.

This experience underscores the profound impact that data quality has on machine learning outcomes. Noisy data can lead to decreased accuracy, overfitting, and misleading insights, as models may struggle to discern true patterns from erroneous information. Addressing such challenges often necessitates comprehensive data cleaning or, as in our case, the adoption of an alternative dataset to ensure reliable and valid results.
